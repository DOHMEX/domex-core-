# Domex Cross-Chain Architecture (Step 10)

Domex supports cross-chain liquidity coordination via **zero-knowledge bridge clients**. These bridges are proof-based, asynchronous, and trustless, replacing multisigs or oracles with cryptographic verification.

---

## 🌉 Supported Chains

- ✅ Cosmos (ZK bridge in development)
- ✅ Ethereum (ZK proof pipeline underway)
- 🔜 Solana (planned for late 2025)
- 🔜 Other L1s and L2s via custom zk-clients

---

## 🧠 Bridge Design Principles

- **Client-Side ZK Proofs**: Proofs are generated by users or bridge scripts on the source chain.
- **Vault-agnostic Entry**: Tokens are not pre-bound to vaults on import; vault mapping happens during trading.
- **Exit-Only Finality**: Withdrawals require vault burn + zk-proof, verified by global validators.
- **No Locking Contracts**: Domex does not rely on on-chain contracts holding user assets.
- **Multi-Bridge Parallelization**: Multiple bridge clients can operate independently.

## 🔁 Deposit Flow (Onboarding)

1. User sends asset (e.g., BTC or ETH) to monitored source chain address
2. Bridge client generates zk-proof of transaction inclusion and sender identity
3. User submits proof to Domex validator set
4. Validator verifies and credits equivalent dToken (e.g., dBTC) to user vault

---

## 🔄 Exit Flow (Withdrawal)

1. Vault owner burns dTokens and submits zk-proof of ownership + burn
2. Validators verify proof and include in finalized Merkle root
3. zkBridge client sees exit root and releases native asset from source chain custody
4. User receives native asset on original chain

---

## ⚠️ Fraud-Proof Windows (Optional)

For optimistic or light-client bridges:
- A **fraud-proof window** may be applied (e.g., 2–10 blocks)
- If invalid exit is detected, slashing is triggered on validator set
- Used only for chains without native ZK verifiability

---

## 📊 Multi-Chain State Sync

Domex supports **parallel state sync** for all active bridge clients. Each bridge maintains its own:
- Proof registry
- Exit commitment root
- Native chain client state

These are merged by validators into a **single global Merkle state root**.

## 🔐 Security Summary

| Component       | Guarantee              |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Proof of Entry** | Generated on source chain (ZK) |
| **Vault Credit** | Triggered only by valid zk proof |
| **Exit Trigger** | Vault burn + validator proof check |
| **Replay Prevention** | All zk proofs are vault-bound and non-reusable |
| **Slashing** | Validators penalized for finalizing invalid bridge events |

> Domex bridges are trustless by design — not reliant on relayers, oracles, or multisigs. Only zero-knowledge counts.

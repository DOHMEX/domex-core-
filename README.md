# Domex

**ZK-native blockchain for global liquidity coordination**

Domex replaces traditional transaction-based blockchains with a vault-state execution model triggered by zero-knowledge proofs. This unlocks highly scalable, verifiable, and permissionless market coordination.

## üîç Project Vision

Markets today are fragmented. Liquidity is siloed across blockchains, apps, and exchanges, with no unified access or composability.

**Domex introduces a universal, shared order book secured by zk-proofs.** It creates a permissionless financial layer where market activity is triggered by cryptographic proofs ‚Äî not transactions or smart contracts.

## üß† Core Innovations

- **Vault-State Execution**  
  Market actions (trade, withdraw, onboard) are triggered by zero-knowledge proofs tied to vault state transitions.  
  ‚Üí No transactions. No wallets. No gas.

- **Global Liquidity Layer**  
  Vaults function as pooled order boards connected via local matching engines and globally finalized by ZK-verified Merkle roots.

- **Quantum-Safe Identity**  
  Domex replaces private keys with Poseidon-based zk identities. No ECDSA. No signing. Fully quantum-resistant.

- **Validator zk-Finality**  
  Global validators finalize state only when zk-SNARK proofs are valid and Merkle root transitions are cryptographically correct.  
  ‚Üí Validators do not run transactions ‚Äî they verify, finalize, and publish state.

- **Local Matching Engine**  
  Vaults are operated by Raft-style local consensus for microsecond-level trade execution, with finality handled globally.

## ‚úÖ What Domex *Does Not* Use

- ‚ùå No smart contracts  
- ‚ùå No wallets or keys  
- ‚ùå No mempools  
- ‚ùå No transaction fees  
- ‚ùå No on-chain bridges or wrapped assets  

All market interaction occurs through off-chain zk clients that submit proofs of ownership, trade intent, or withdrawal ‚Äî validated by the protocol.

---

## üß© Proof-Driven Cross-Chain Access

Assets like BTC, ETH, and others can enter Domex *without bridges*. Instead:

- Client generates zk-proof of a valid on-chain deposit (e.g., BTC tx)
- Submits to Domex validator
- Validator verifies and mints dToken to the user‚Äôs vault
- Exit requires vault burn + zk proof of identity and withdrawal

Domex never holds custody ‚Äî validators only verify. Bridges are external scripts, not Domex components.

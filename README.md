# Domex

**ZK-native blockchain for global liquidity coordination**

Domex replaces traditional transaction-based blockchains with a vault-state execution model triggered by zero-knowledge proofs. This unlocks highly scalable, verifiable, and permissionless market coordination.

## üîç Project Vision

Markets today are fragmented. Liquidity is siloed across blockchains, apps, and exchanges, with no unified access or composability.

**Domex introduces a universal, shared order book secured by zk-proofs.** It creates a permissionless financial layer where market activity is triggered by cryptographic proofs ‚Äî not transactions or smart contracts.

## üß† Core Innovations

- **Vault-State Execution**  
  Market actions are triggered by zero-knowledge proofs tied to vault state transitions. No transactions. No gas.

- **Global Liquidity Layer**  
  Unified, permissionless order book for DeFi and OTC flows ‚Äî across chains.

- **Quantum-Safe Identity**  
  Uses Poseidon hash-based identities (no ECDSA). Domex is quantum-resistant by default.

- **Validator zk-Finality**  
  Finality and slashing enforced through zk-SNARK circuits and Merkle state verification.

- **Local Matching Engine**  
  DApps operate real-time Raft-style consensus for vault logic, with global zkMerkle finality.

## üåê Cross-Chain Support

Domex supports proof-based asset bridges via:

- Cosmos (client-side zk)
- Ethereum
- Solana (planned)
- More via custom zk clients

Bridged assets are verified with client-side ZK proofs and made tradable in the global vault layer.

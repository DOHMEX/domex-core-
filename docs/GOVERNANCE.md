# Domex Governance: Token Onboarding & Gatekeeper DAO (Step 8)

To preserve the integrity of the Domex trading layer, every token onboarded into the vault system must pass through a **governance and verification flow**. This ensures only valid, auditable assets are made liquid on the shared book.

## ðŸ§± Governance Model

Domex uses a **modular, zk-auditable onboarding process** governed by the **Gatekeeper DAO**.

## ðŸ”„ Token Onboarding Lifecycle

1. **Asset Proposal**
   - A proposer (individual, protocol, DAO, or bridge partner) submits a token onboarding request
   - Required metadata:
     - Native chain (e.g., BTC, ETH, Cosmos)
     - Bridge proof format (e.g., Groth16, PLONK)
     - ZK circuit hash
     - Economic use case and liquidity estimate

2. **ZK Circuit Review**
   - Submitted bridge circuits are verified for:
     - Correct proof-of-origin (e.g., BTC deposit)
     - Poseidon-bound identity mapping
     - Compatibility with vault execution model
   - Verifiers hash = added to Merkle registry

3. **DAO Voting**
   - Gatekeeper DAO

# Domex Protocol Roadmap

Domex is building a ZK-native execution layer to unify global liquidity. This roadmap outlines our phased development approach from testnet to validator decentralization.

---

## ✅ Completed (Q1–Q2 2025)

- ✅ Vault-state execution model finalized  
- ✅ ZK identity system (Poseidon) implemented  
- ✅ Local vault consensus (Raft) logic stable  
- ✅ Global validator zk-finality model locked  
- ✅ Trade intent schema + matching API defined  
- ✅ ZK withdrawal logic fully designed  
- ✅ Governance framework for token onboarding approved  

---

## 🔄 In Progress (Q3 2025)

- 🔄 Cosmos ZK bridge client (deposit + exit verifier)  
- 🔄 Ethereum ZK bridge client  
- 🔄 Shared vault matching interface (DOM + proof UI)  
- 🔄 zk-audit tooling for validator-side verification  
- 🔄 Verkle Merkle root integration for exits  
- 🔄 MVP for multi-market matching board (UX + backend)  

---

## 🔜 Upcoming (Q4 2025)

- 🔜 Public Testnet Launch (with BTC, USDT pairs)  
- 🔜 Validator onboarding via zk DAO governance  
- 🔜 Proof bounty program for withdrawal attacks + exit delays  
- 🔜 Full Merkle registry for onboarding-eligible tokens  
- 🔜 Ecosystem partner integrations (DEXs, OTC platforms)  
- 🔜 Verifier audit of zk circuits (vault entry, exit, identity)  

---

## 🛠️ Early 2026

- 🔐 Mainnet Launch (Post audit and validator test cycle)  
- 📦 Token onboarding flow with full DAO voting + slashing protection  
- 🌉 Parallel bridge support for additional chains (Solana, L2s)  
- 🧠 Bot + DAO delegation system via Poseidon delegate hash  
- 📊 Liquidity coordination layer exposed via external API  

---

## 📈 Long-Term (2026–2027)

- 🧱 SDK for building DApps using vault-based execution  
- 🛰️ zkBridge module for real-time liquidity sync across chains  
- 🛡️ Formal verification for zk circuits  
- 🔁 Continuous global Merkle snapshot publishing  
- 🌍 Cross-chain vault arbitration with fraud-proof fallback  
- 🏛️ Gatekeeper DAO and Validator DAO fully decentralized

Domex aims to unlock **scalable, trustless liquidity across the entire crypto ecosystem**, one proof at a time.

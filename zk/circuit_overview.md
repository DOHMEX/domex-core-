# ZK Circuit Overview: Domex Vault & Identity Logic

Domex uses modular zero-knowledge circuits to replace traditional transaction logic.  
Each circuit is off-chain generatable, auditable, and verifiable by Domex global validators.  
This guarantees trustless execution for vault operations, identity enforcement, and asset onboarding/withdrawal.
